# Giphy (AJAX)

With the help of the Giphy API, I created a webpage that will populate with gifs of the user's choice. The starting theme is musicians, but users are able to search for whatever they would like and the page will populate ten gifs of their choosing. 

Once the user chooses a search term, the term will append to the page for them to click on. Ten gifs will then populate, each one beginning as static. The user then has the ability to click on those gifs to make them animate. 

Each gif will display with its corresponding rating from the Giphy API.
